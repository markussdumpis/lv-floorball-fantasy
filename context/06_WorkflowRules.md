# Workflow Rules for Cursor Agent

- Always read this file and 01_PRD.md before coding.
- Treat the user as the Product Owner.
- Never make assumptions beyond what’s in context.
- Always summarize your understanding before writing code.
- Follow 02_ImplementationPlan.md for the next feature phase.
- For UI → use Expo + React Native conventions.
- For backend → use Supabase JS client.
- Always comment your code for beginners (explain logic clearly).
- When refactoring → explain reasoning before changing files.
- When confused → ask clarifying questions, don’t hallucinate.
- Output diffs clearly, not full files unless requested.
- Keep code readable and modular (small components, named hooks).
